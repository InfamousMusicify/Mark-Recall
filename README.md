Adds in a Mark and Recall ability similar to what TES games had untill oblivion.

          Craft:
     Throw 3 Eye of enders, and Pieces of paper on the ground together and you will recieve 3 Marks.
     Place a mark on the ground to mark your location, you will be given a recall Item.
     Place Recall on the ground to return to Mark.
          Command:
     /trigger sw_help
     Will explain how things work in-game.
     /function sw:uninstall to unisntall the scoreboards for the datapack. (useful when updating versions)
     
     A special Thank you to Xisuma and the Vanilla Tweaks Team for putting together 
     the beautiful sethome datapack upon which this is based. <3
     Made this for my own server but I thought other folks may appreciate its functionality.
